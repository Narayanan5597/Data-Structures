1. Dijkstra Algorithm

   Time complexity: O((V+E)logV)
   Space Complexity: O(V)

 Q: What if you only have heapq, can you still make Dijkstra work (with the built-in heapq)?
    Can you re-analyze the time/space complexities?
    yes It can be reanalysed 
    Time  : O(V+ElogE)
   
   Q: Is Dijkstra a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming algorithm?
      Overall, it is a dynamic programming algorithm. But at every node, it is greedy- it chooses the best possible path    

   Q: for problems that can be solved by both Dijkstra and Viterbi, which one is faster?
      It Depends on the problem

2. Time complexity : O(N^2*2^N)
   Space Complexity: O(2^n)
