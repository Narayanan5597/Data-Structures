 Which of the following sorting algorithms are (or can be made) stable?
   (a) mergesort is a strictly stable algorithm 
   (b) quicksort with the first element as pivot is not stable but there are possibilties that it can be made stable
   (c) quicksort with randomized pivot is not stable but there are possibilties that it can be made stable
   (d) selection sort (assuming you've learned it in data structures) is not stable but there are possibilties that it can be made stable
   (e) insertion sort (assuming you've learned it in data structures) is strictly stable 
   (f) heap sort --- not covered yet (see CLRS Ch. 6) is not stable and cannot be made stable
