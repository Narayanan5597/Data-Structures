 (1) insert each element into the heap  --- O(nlogn) -- heapq.heappush()
 (2) heapify (top-down)                 --- O(n)     -- heapq.heapify()

 (a)  heapq.heappush() - The algorithm takes O(nlogn) to push all the n elements.
            O(n) to maintain the heap and O(logn) to push
0.2. heapq.heapify()
            - MAX-HEAPIFY when called on a node of height h is O(h)
            - Build max heap is bounded by Summation(n/2^h+1) where h from 0:logn
            - Taking n as common will become => n*Summation(1/2^h+1) where h from 0:logn

 (b) a = random.sample(range(100000), 10000)
   %timeit heapq.heapify(a) -> 1000 loops, best of 3: 674 Âµs per loop
   %timeit heapq.heappush(a,1) -> 1000000 loops, best of 3: 205 ns per loop
 
 (c) For an array or list which is sorted in reverse order , Max Heap would take O(1) 


1) (a) O(n^2 (logn))
   (b) O(n^2)
   (c) O(nlogn)

2) K way merge sort is similar to merge sort whose basic functionality is to divide the random array into n times 
  and then it performs combine operation recursively. Similarly for k sorted arrays  it would take log k times to combine the 
  k arrays into one sorted array. So the overall time complexity would be (k n log k) 
  
    T(n) = k.T(n/k) + O (k+nlogk)   k<<n
    k.T(n/k) + O (nlogk)
    nlogk.logkn
    nlogk. (logn/logk)
    nlogk

3) Time Complexity for heapq.heappush(queue, -1* arr[i] ) = K times Log k
   Time Complexity for heap.heapreplace = (n - k) times log k 
   K log k  + (n - k) log k = n log k
