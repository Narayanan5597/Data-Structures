1. best:

(regardless of CKY or Nussinov)
O(n^3) time, O(n^2) space

2. total:

(only Nussinov works)
same as the above (just different semiring operators).

3. kbest:

(see midterm q3 for analysis)

O(E + V k log d_max) => O(n^3 + n^2 k log (n+k))

if k << n and you run qselect before heapify (optional minor speedup):
O(E + V k log k) => O(n^3 + n^2 k log k)

Notes:

1. This is Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005), as in our implementations.
Algorithm 3 in that paper reduces it further to O(n^3 + n k log k) by only solving the k-best for the final node (and not for all nodes), but that's beyond the scope of this course.

2. You can use CKY but then you need to check for duplicate structures due to overcounting; if you use Nussinov (as in KT), you don't need that check as there is no overcounting.

3. The Final will feature k-best Viterbi on graph instead of hypergraph, using a skeleton code similar to (but simpler than) our codes.
